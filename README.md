# exoscene

**exoscene** is a library of classes and utility functions for simulating direct 
images of exoplanetary systems.

A jupyter notebook providing usage examples for much of the functionality is included under the docs subdirectory:
[exoscene/docs/notebooks/Roman-CGI_scene_demo.ipynb]()

The functions are organized in 3 modules: [exoscene/planet.py](), [exoscene/star.py](), and [exoscene/image.py]()
